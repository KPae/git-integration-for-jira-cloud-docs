Classic full feature integration gives you access to all features for the connected git servers. But it requires two-way communication originating from outside of your network. Thus, you will need to allow incoming requests by updating your network/firewall settings. For more information, see [Allow list (whitelist) BigBrassBand Cloud.](https://link.bigbrassband.com/kb-gitcloud-allow-list-whitelist%5D)

Webhook indexing integration allows your connected git servers to work behind a firewall. This is its main aspect. However, the downside is that your integration will have limited features which are stated under the Connect to your Git server features table. For now, the supported git servers are GitHub.com, GitLab and Microsoft. More will be coming in the future. For more information, see [Webhooks indexing explainer](https://bigbrassband.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GITCLOUD/pages/1422819484/Webhook+Indexing+Explainer?src=search).
