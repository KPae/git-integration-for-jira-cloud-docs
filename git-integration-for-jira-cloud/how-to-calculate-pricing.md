2.  See pricing details on the [Atlassian Marketplace: Git Integration for Jira](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/4984/git-integration-for-jira?hosting=cloud&tab=pricing)
3.  Install the [Git Integration for Jira](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/4984/git-integration-for-jira?hosting=cloud&tab=pricing)Â then go to `[https://replacewithyourJiraname.atlassian.net/admin/billing/estimate](https://replacewithyourJiraname.atlassian.net/admin/billing/estimate)`. The estimated monthly or annual price will be quoted.
4.  [Contact Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/company/contact/purchasing-licensing) to create a quote. You can expect an answer within a business day.
