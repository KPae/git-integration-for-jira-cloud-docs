The Git Integration for Jira app currently supports **Jira** **8.0** to **9.5**!

We are committed to provide you with an efficient and reliable support. Scroll down to see helpful tips to get started.

## Browser Compatibility

Atlassian has released mobile app versions of their Jira software.

The Git Integration for Jira Cloud app supports the desktop browsers that Atlassian supports for Jira Cloud. However, mobile browsers are not officially supported. This means that the desktop version of Git Integration for Jira Cloud app will not work using Android or iOS web browsers.

For more information, see [**Atlassian Jira Cloud Supported Browsers**](https://confluence.atlassian.com/cloud/supported-browsers-744721663.html).

No changes necessary to your Git server. This Jira app acts as a regular Git client.

Using Atlassian's marketplace system, a Jira administrator can install the Git Integration for Jira app without ever leaving the web browser.

## **Retiring IE11 Support**

With the release of the Edge browser since 2015, IE has not been receiving major updates. Atlassian has stated in their [**blog**](https://blog.developer.atlassian.com/retiring-ie11-support-for-atlassian-cloud-server-and-data-center-products/) that they will withdraw support for IE11 on all Jira products.

In view of this, BigBrassBand LLC will also follow this decision effectively:

*   For all Atlassian Cloud products, support will end on **31 March 2020**.

*   For Atlassian server and data center products, the last version to support IE11 will be released between **September 2019** and **March 2020**.
