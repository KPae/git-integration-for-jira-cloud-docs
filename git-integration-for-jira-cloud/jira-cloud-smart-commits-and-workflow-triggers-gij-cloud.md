Smart commits allows your team to perform actions on Jira issues from a single commit. Users can enter the issue key and the desired action such as time tracking or closing an issue.

The smart commit processing is **active by default** and can be enabled/disabled via **General settings** _(Jira dashboard menu Apps ➜ Git Integration: Manage Git repositories ➜ (sidebar) General Settings)._
