Self-signed certificates are common in HTTPS Git repositories that are hosted privately. Even for an administrator, it's not easy to set the HTTP `sslVerify` to connect to this repository.

The Jira administrator now has the option to disable `sslVerify` for specific repositories while inside Jira.

This feature is available in **Connect to Git Repository** wizard and the **Full feature integration** panel for GitHub and GitLab.

Continue to the next topic for further information on setup and integration.
