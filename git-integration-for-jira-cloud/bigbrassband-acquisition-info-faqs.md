[Git Integration for Jira](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/4984/git-integration-for-jira?hosting=cloud&tab=overview) (GIJ) seamlessly combines Git data and workflows into a Jira team’s project and issue-oriented context while GitKraken presents Jira issues and projects to developers in a highly visual developer-oriented Git environment. Together the two products will improve how teams interact with Git.
