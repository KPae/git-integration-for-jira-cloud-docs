## What is Jira Development Information?

[**Jira Development Information**](/git-integration-for-jira-cloud/jira-development-information-gij-cloud) is a suite of new features available in Jira Software on the Cloud platform that puts commits, branches, and pull requests in context of Jira issue. These settings can be configured to "push" development information (commits, branches, and pull requests) directly into your Jira Cloud instance.

After all the settings have been configured according to your requirements, click **Update** to apply the changes.
