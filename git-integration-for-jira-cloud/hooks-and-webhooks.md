[Client-side Hook](/wiki/spaces/GITCLOUD/pages/179011603/Commit-msg+Hook)

The **_commit-msg_** hook is a python script file that must be located in the developer's local repository.

  

[Server-side Hook](/wiki/spaces/GITCLOUD/pages/179044399/Server-side+Hook)

Use server-side hooks to apply policies for your project.  The server runs these scripts before and after the push.  The server-side hook, like commit-msg hook, requires Python to be installed.

  

[Indexing Triggers](/wiki/spaces/GITCLOUD/pages/171475219/Indexing+Triggers)

Trigger immediate reindex of your repositories from remote systems via webhooks.
