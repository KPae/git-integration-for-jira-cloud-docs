The Repository Browser is a feature that offers a view into your connected repositories with Jira Cloud. From the **Repository browser** page you can see summaries such as repository, most recent issue associated by a commit, last updated by commit author, last commit date/time and etc.

**Permissions**
Jira users must have the **Browse Project** _permissions_ to a project associated with a repository to view.


Disabling this feature, hides the **Git Integration: Repository browser** – dashboard Apps menu context.

After all the settings have been configured according to your requirements, click **Update** to apply the changes.
