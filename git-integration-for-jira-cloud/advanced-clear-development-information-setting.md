Behind the **Advanced** twisty is a button that gives Jira administrators the ability to clear out all Development Information associated with the Git Integration for Jira app.

This action takes some time to process and Development Information may be visible in places until the process finishes. Expect the process to take up to one (1) hour.


After all the settings have been configured according to your requirements, click **Update** to apply the changes.
