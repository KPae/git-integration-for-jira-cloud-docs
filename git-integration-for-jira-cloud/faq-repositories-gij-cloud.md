## We use GitBlit without SSH keys and use only HTTPS instead.  Does Git Integration Plugin for Jira support this?

Yes. The Git Integration for Jira Cloud app definitely supports GitBlit via HTTPS authentication. Use the **Connect to Git Repository** wizard to connect to your repositories. Towards the end of the process, a username and password will be required for connection authentication.
