[Client-side Hook](/git-integration-for-jira-cloud/commit-msg-hook/)

The **_commit-msg_** hook is a python script file that must be located in the developer's local repository.



[Server-side Hook](/git-integration-for-jira-cloud/server-side-hook/)

Use server-side hooks to apply policies for your project.  The server runs these scripts before and after the push.  The server-side hook, like commit-msg hook, requires Python to be installed.

Trigger immediate reindex of your repositories from remote systems via webhooks.
