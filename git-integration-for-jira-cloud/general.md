## **What is Git?**

Git is a source code repository.  Developers keep track of their source code using Git. Git relies heavily on branching and merging.  Branching is making a temporary copy of source code for a single purpose like adding a particular feature or fixing a bug.  Merging is safely moving the changes from one branch back to another.

  

## **What is this app?**

This is Git Integration for Jira Cloud – an app for Jira that mashes together data from a Git server with your Jira Cloud.  It let's people see code from Git in context with Jira issues.

  

## **Why would I want to see Git in my Jira?**

Git can be complicated and daunting – especially for non-developers.  Jira users want this app so they can work with Git in the familiar Jira interface.

  

## **How do Git and Jira work together?**

In organizations with Git and Jira, it is common to have a branch for each Jira issue and branches for every version.

When developers put their work in Git, they can include a Jira issue key in the comments.  With the Git Integration for Jira app installed, Jira Cloud will then show the changes in the issue.

  

## **Is this safe? Will it cause trouble?**

It is a safe and well-tested plugin.

We test this on huge Git repositories in large Jira instances.  Over 5000 organizations in 70 countries use the Git Integration for Jira app.
