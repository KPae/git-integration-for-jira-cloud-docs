The Git Integration for Jira Cloud app automatically configures web links for most git hosts via Git service integration panel.

For single git repository integration, web link setup is optional. However, git links will become available in Git Commits tab when configured.

For more information, see [Documentation: Web Linking](/git-integration-for-jira-cloud/Web-linking).
