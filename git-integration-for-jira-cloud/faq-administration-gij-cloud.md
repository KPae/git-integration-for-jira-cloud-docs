### Does Jira+GitHub integration support multiple Jira projects (many) to multiple git repositories (many)?  If it does not, how about many-to-one or one-to-many?

Yes â€” it does support repositories supporting many projects. That said, the associations are made by the developers when they commit code to a specific issue key (which is part of a project). The permission that allows a user to see these commits in a Jira project is whether they have the "View Development Tools" permission for that project (that's a Jira setting).
