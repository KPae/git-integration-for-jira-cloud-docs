VERSION 2.6.33+
Implemented support for multi-line commit messages with smart commits.


The following examples show correct usage of the smart commit message:

|     |
| --- |
| **TST-1** implemented feature 1  <br>**TST-1** **#comment** some comment  <br>in Jira  <br>on several lines  <br>**TST-1** **#resolve**  <br>**TST-2** **#time** 1h 30m |
| _In this example, an issue key that is present on every line is a valid multi-line commit message._ |

|     |
| --- |
| **TST-1** implemented feature 1  <br>**#comment** some comment  <br>in Jira on several lines  <br>**#resolve** TST-2  <br>**#time** 1h 30m |
| _This is the equivalent smart commit message based from the above example._ |

|     |
| --- |
| **TEST-3** Background color of settings should be lighter  <br>**TEST-3** **#in-progress** **#time** 1h  <br>**TEST-4** resolve **TEST-2** **#resolve** |
| _This example, containing several issue keys, is also a valid multi-line smart commit message._ |
