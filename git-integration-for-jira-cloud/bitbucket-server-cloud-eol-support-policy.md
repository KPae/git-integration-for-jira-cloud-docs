## Bitbucket Server

End of life support for the latest version, older versions and supported platforms are listed in the [Bitbucket EOL support announcement page](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/end-of-support-announcements-for-bitbucket-server-776640855.html).

## Bitbucket Cloud

Atlassian occasionally remove existing features and functions from Bitbucket Cloud in order to provide the best user experience possible.
