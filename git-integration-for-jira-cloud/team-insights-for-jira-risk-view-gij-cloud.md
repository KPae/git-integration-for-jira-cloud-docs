Risks play a critical role in highlighting sprints or issues that may not be progressing as anticipated. It draws attention to potential problems or delays in the project timeline. These risks can be individually tracked, which enables project managers to either activate or deactivate them based on the project's evolving status. Furthermore, each risk can be assigned a severity level. This allows for a more distinct understanding of the impact each risk may have on the overall project. 

When an issue or sprint reaches a predefined risk threshold, a visual alert is automatically triggered on the project timeline. This indicator marks the presence of a risk and its severity. Thus, team managers can assess, classify and prioritize the urgency of the potential impact and the severity of the risk. 

Overall, the Risk View Settings helps prioritize which risks require immediate attention and resources to mitigate, ensuring the project stays on track.
