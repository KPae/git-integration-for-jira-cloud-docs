In the Jira search interface you will have a new column to add: **Development**.

This column is displayed in the following order of precedence:

1.  **Blank** (no commits or pull requests are declined/closed)
    
2.  **\# of Commits** (when no pull requests are associated)
    
3.  **Merged** (all associated pull requests are merged or closed)
    
4.  **Under Review** (at least one associated pull request is open)
