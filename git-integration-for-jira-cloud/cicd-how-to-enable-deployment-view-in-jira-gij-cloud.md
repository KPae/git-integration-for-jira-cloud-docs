Jira includes a timeline that shows deployments across environments. You can search deployments by issues, environments, types and more.

By default this feature is turned off, and must be turned on.

<div class="bbb-callout bbb--alert">
    <div class="irow">
    <div class="ilogobox">
        <span class="logoimg"></span>
    </div>
    <div class="imsgbox">
        You must be a project admin to enable and disable features on a project. You must also have the **View Development Tools** permission to enable the Deployments feature.

3.  Enable the Deployments feature.

    <img src='/wp-content/uploads/gij-cloud-cicd-deployments-view-3.png' height=196 width=956 style='margin: 15px auto 25px auto; max-width: 100%' />

A new menu item, Deployments, will be added to the left-hand project menu (under Operations).
