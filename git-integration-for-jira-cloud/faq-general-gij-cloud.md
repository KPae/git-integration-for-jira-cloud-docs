## What is Git?

Git is a source code repository. Developers keep track of their source code using Git. Git relies heavily on branching and merging. Branching is making a temporary copy of source code for a single purpose like adding a particular feature or fixing a bug. Merging is safely moving the changes from one branch back to another.

## What is this app?

This is Git Integration for Jira Cloud – an app for Jira that mashes together data from a Git server with your Jira Cloud. It let's people see code from Git in context with Jira issues.

## Why would I want to see Git in my Jira?

Git can be complicated and daunting – especially for non-developers.  Jira users want this app so they can work with Git in the familiar Jira interface.

## How do Git and Jira work together?

In organizations with Git and Jira, it is common to have a branch for each Jira issue and branches for every version.

When developers put their work in Git, they can include a Jira issue key in the comments. With the Git Integration for Jira app installed, Jira Cloud will then show the changes in the issue.

## Is this safe? Will it cause trouble?

It is a safe and well-tested plugin.

We test this on huge Git repositories in large Jira instances. Over 5000 organizations in 70 countries use the Git Integration for Jira app.
