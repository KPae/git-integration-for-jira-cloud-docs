# Release Hub: Warnings 

<https://bigbrassband.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GITCLOUD/pages/1941373081>

* * *

The Release Hub can be accessed within a Jira project at the **Releases** page. Jira issues with a fix version assigned will appear in the Release Hub.

Currently two types of warnings are available:

*   **Open pull requests:** These issues have been marked complete but have open pull requests.
    
*   **Unreviewed Code:** These issues have been marked complete but the commits are not part of a pull request or review.
