# What is GIJ (Git integration for Jira) Advanced?
GIJ Advanced is a higher tier edition of our application that is catered for clients that want greater indexing performance and less maintenance, as well as Product and Engineering teams who need to monitor risks and consistently meet deadlines. Advanced edition clients will benefit from better performance and higher configuration limits for number of repositories. In order to ensure that clients needs are met, there are limitations built into the applications that will determine which version you will need to use.
