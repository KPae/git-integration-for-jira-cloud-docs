Enable this setting to turn on the deep linking feature which allows you to quickly move between Jira and your Git source code with the GitKraken git client app. GitKraken supports deep linking into Git Integration for Jira as well. To learn more about this feature, see [GitKraken Integrations: Git Integration for Jira](https://support.gitkraken.com/integrations/git-integration-for-jira/).

**Permissions**
The **View developer tools** _permission_ is required to view the git commits. Jira users must also have the **Browse Project** _permissions_ to a project associated with a repository to view.


For more details, see [Features: Deep Linking to the GitKraken Git client (Jira Cloud)](/wiki/spaces/GITCLOUD/pages/1952579617/Deep+Linking+to+the+GitKraken+client).

After all the settings have been configured according to your requirements, click **Update** to apply the changes.
