There are four (4) options for calculating Jira Cloud prices:

1.  Use the [Atlassian Cloud Pricing Calculator](https://www.atlassian.com/software/pricing-calculator). First choose between **monthly/annual**, enter the **\# of seats** your Jira is licensed for, select **Apps**, select **Git Integration for Jira (Top Selling)** from the list of dropdowns.

2.  See pricing details on the [Atlassian Marketplace: Git Integration for Jira](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/4984/git-integration-for-jira?hosting=cloud&tab=pricing)

3.  Install the [Git Integration for Jira](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/4984/git-integration-for-jira?hosting=cloud&tab=pricing)Â then go to `https://replace-with-your-Jira-Org-Name.atlassian.net/admin/billing/estimate`. The estimated monthly or annual price will be quoted.

4.  [Contact Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/company/contact/purchasing-licensing) to create a quote. You can expect an answer within a business day.
