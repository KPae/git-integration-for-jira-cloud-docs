Add a public SSH key to your remote git host to prepare its repositories for connection with the Git Integration for Jira app.

Do the following steps to setup SSH for your remote git host:

1.  Login to your remote git host service.

2.  Go to the SSH configuration page, if supported.

    See examples, [Adding SSH key in GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) or [Adding SSH key in GitLab](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

3.  Paste the public key to the provided box (GitLab) or upload the public key file and complete the setup (GitHub).

4.  Verify your SSH connection to the git host server.
