Hover the mouse pointer on the name of the user.  A small information box containing information such as email, zone & time and avatar for that user will appear.

Click **Reported issues** to view the latest reported issues performed by that user.

Click **View profile** to view this user’s profile.

The [**Git user identity**](/wiki/spaces/GITCLOUD/pages/1923023946/Git+user+Identity) should be configured for the specific user. Otherwise, the user card information will not be displayed for that user.
