## How do I determine the Git Integration for Jira app pricing after the trial?

There are four ways to determine the pricing:

1.  Install the [Git Integration for Jira](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/4984/git-integration-for-jira?hosting=cloud&tab=pricing) app then go to:

    ```powershell
    https://[replacewithyourJiraname].atlassian.net/admin/billing/estimate
    ```

    The estimated monthly or annual price will be quoted.

2.  See pricing details on the [Atlassian Marketplace: Git Integration for Jira](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/4984/git-integration-for-jira?hosting=cloud&tab=pricing).

3.  Use the [Atlassian Cloud Pricing Calculator](https://www.atlassian.com/software/pricing-calculator):

    *   Choose between **monthly/annual**.
    *   Enter the **number of seats** your Jira is licensed for.
    *   Select **Apps**.
    *   Select **Git Integration for Jira _(Top Selling)_** from the dropdown list.

4.  Create a quote on [Atlassian.com](https://www.atlassian.com/purchase/addon/com.xiplink.jira.git.jira_git_plugin).

    Select the **Quote** option then **Deployment** (Server/Cloud/DC) and follow the instructions.

All four should provide the same answer.
